        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <h4>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h4>
        <li>Positives - Youtube is free, they pay for storing the file and playing it.</li>
        <li>Negatives - Your competitor can put their own advertisement on your video and can have people click on their links.</li>
        <h4>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h4>
        <li>This allows you to move and rotate frames. Even though you can upscale and use a translate value, you said in the video that it might be more practical to use rotate as this does not take up or interfere with other elements' spaces.</li>
        <h4>How do you stay safe online?</h4>
        <li>I couldn't hear well what was said regarding this question but I believe using safe websites and making sure that they have safety protocal featured on their website, also not sharing passwords and not displaying any sensitive things online will keep you safe.</li>
        <h4>What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</h4>
        <li>Same thing with this I did not hear the answer but we covered the the audio and video engagement, discussed more on the contents we need to create for our final project and the time line for at least 3 pages to be made which is on Monday, 25th next week.</li>
