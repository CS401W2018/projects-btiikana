        <p>The katana emerged during the Kamakura period (1185â€“1333) in Japan, evolving from earlier sword designs to feature a curved, single-edged blade ideal for quick, decisive strikes. As the weapon of choice for samurai, it became a symbol of their status and a key element of Japanese martial culture.</p>

        <p>The Arabian sword, particularly the scimitar, is known for its graceful curve, which allows for powerful slashing attacks and was often used by skilled horsemen in battle. Historically, these swords were crafted with intricate designs and were not just weapons but also symbols of status and artistry in Arab culture.</p>

        <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
        <p>The English longsword emerged during the late Middle Ages, evolving from earlier sword designs to become a symbol of chivalry and martial prowess, favored by knights and noble warriors. Its distinctive double-edged blade and intricate hilt designs were not only functional in battle but also reflected the artistry and craftsmanship of the era, leading to its lasting legacy in both combat and culture.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h5>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h5>
        <p>The difference between the two is one can separate other elements automatically while the other doesn't separate but might overlap other elements. For instance, the img tag will not create space automatically to separate elements but the link anchor will separate other elements.</p>
        <h5>What is normal flow in HTML?</h5>
        <p>A normal flow is a default layout of elements in the html. When elements aren't altered from their original formation or settings that is normal flow.</p>
        <h5>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h5>
        <p>A float will allow the inline and block elements wrap around each other or share room together.</p>
        <h5>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h5>
        <p>Absolute places elements nearest to the elements' parents, fixed keeps the element visible when the window or display is changing and a relative will change the position of the elements' original spot but will still affect other elements.</p>
        <h5>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h5>
        <p>You may use a fixed positioning so that the navigation will stay visible when users surf the web page without needing to go back up to the menus and also absolute positioning will be great for drop down menus.</p>
        <h5>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h5>
        <p>The videos can be found at the "Home" section that will lead to "Introduction", there will be "Lecture Notes" there but the rest of the lecture notes can be accessed when "View all pages" is clicked.</p>
