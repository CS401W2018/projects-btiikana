    <h1>Web Development: Structural Tags</h1>
<hr>
</header>
<main>
 <h3>1. Structural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER)</h3>
 <p><b>Header:</b> "&lt;header&gt;" and &lt;/header&gt;"</p>
 <p><b>Navigation:</b> "&lt;nav&gt;" and &lt;/nav&gt;"</p>
 <p><b>Main:</b> "&lt;main&gt;" and "&lt;/main&gt;"</p>
 <p><b>Footer:</b> "&lt;footer&gt;" and "&lt;/footer&gt;"</p>
 <h3>2. What goes in the header?</h3>
  <p> - Contents that are usually preferred on top of the page, like titles and they don't change when the page is loaded.</p>
 <h3>3. What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h3>
  <p>- Links to web pages are located here. A navigation can be placed in the header, it's common this way but doesn't have to be all the time. The Navigation might have a slight change when the "highlight" marker is displayed. And it can contain links for the internal web pages but for the outbounds can be possible but would not make sense to do that.</p> 
 <h3>4. What goes in Main?</h3>
  <p>- Contents inside the main part of the web page that will always change when different web pages are loaded.</p>
 <h3>5. What goes in the Footer?</h3>
  <p>- Address, Contact, Copyright, and Policy Information are usually located here.</p>
 <h3>6. HTML Validation</h3>
  <p>It's a process of checking for tag errors, formatting errors for html, xhtml and etc.</p>
