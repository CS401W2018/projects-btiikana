<h1>Structural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER)</h1>
 <h3>1. What goes in the header?</h3>
  <p><b>Header</b>(&lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;) - Contents that are usually preferred on top of the page, and they don't change when the page is loaded.</p>
 <h3>2. What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h3>
  <p><b>Navigation</b>(&lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;) - Links to web pages are located here. They don't usually move but they might have a slight change when the "highlight" marker is displayed.</p> 
 <h3>3. What goes in Main?</h3>
  <p><b>Main</b>(&lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt;) - Contents inside the main part of the web page that will always change when different web pages are loaded.</p>
 <h3>4. What goes in the Footer?</h3>
  <p><b>Footer</b>(&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;) - Address, Contact, Copyright, and Policy Information are usually located here.</p>
 <h3>5. HTML Validation</h3>
