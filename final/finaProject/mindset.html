                        <strong>Challenges</strong><br>
                        As you progress honing your skills, gaining experience and leaving the first phase of the trading hurdles you will face more challenges. Your <strong>response timing</strong>, <strong>critical thinking</strong> and your <strong>ability to contain yourself</strong> will be constantly <strong>tested</strong> every single day for the <strong>rest of your life</strong> if you plan to be a <strong>full time trader</strong>. Below I'll mention a few dilemmas that most traders struggle with everyday and ways to medicate them.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Trading</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Over Trading</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Greed</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>FOMO</strong></li>

                        <strong>Overcome</strong><br>
                        If you don't want to loose constantly or tired of loosing your money, you must force yourself to do the opposite of what you're doing. You must know that a trained and good mindset is crucial for trading and it's not for those other people out there but it applies to everybody in trading and it's real. I'll list down some quick fixes to bad habits and destructive ways of trading.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Do not</strong> place a <strong>trade</strong> when you're <strong>Angry, Sad, or Excited</strong> - You basically have to be <strong>neutral</strong> with your emotions always.</li>
                        <li>You only need to put on a Trade 2-3 times a day - You can never Overtrade when you do this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Convince yourself</strong> always that <strong>$100 is better than nothing</strong> - No more <strong>GREED</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Every 2-5 minutes</strong> there's an <strong>opportunity</strong> in the market - Do not ever <strong>Fear Of Missing Out</strong>!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Doing all of the things I listed above might keep you longer in the game and <strong>DO NOT EVER FORGET</strong> to have good <strong>RISK-MANAGEMENT</strong>
