                            <strong>Challenges</strong><br><br>
                            As you progress in honing your skills, gaining experience and moving past the first phase of the trading hurdles, you will face more challenges. Your <strong>response time</strong>, <strong>critical thinking</strong> and your <strong>ability to control your emotions</strong> will be <strong>tested</strong> every single day for the <strong>rest of your life</strong> if you plan to be a <strong>full-time trader</strong>. Below I'll highlight a few dilemmas that most traders struggle with daily along with ways to address them.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://capital.com/emotions-in-trading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emotional Trading</a> - Every trader tends to make trades based on their emotions, it's not calculated and it's bad.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtrading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over Trading</a> - Traders won't stop putting on trades when they need to get back some losses or just because.</li>

                            <strong>Overcome</strong><br><br>
                            If you don't want to lose constantly or tired of losing your money, you must force yourself to do the opposite of what you're doing. You must know that a trained and good mindset is crucial for trading and it's not for those other people out there but it applies to everybody in trading and it's real. I'll list down some quick fixes to bad habits and destructive ways of trading.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Do not</strong> place a <strong>trade</strong> when you're <strong>Angry, Sad, or Excited</strong> - You basically have to be <strong>neutral</strong> with your emotions always.</li>
                            <li>You only need to put on a Trade <strong>2-3 times a day</strong> - You can never Overtrade when you do this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Convince yourself</strong> always that <strong>$100 is better than nothing</strong> - No more <strong>GREED</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Every 2-5 minutes</strong> there's an <strong>opportunity</strong> in the market - Do not ever <strong>Fear Of Missing Out</strong>!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="text-spacer"></div>
                        <p>
                            Doing all of the things I listed above along with the right <strong>Strategy</strong> might keep you longer in the game and <strong>DO NOT EVER FORGET</strong> to have good <strong>RISK-MANAGEMENT</strong>
                        </p>
