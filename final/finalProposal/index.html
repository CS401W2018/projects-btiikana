        <h1>2. Why this Topic</h1>
            <p>
                There are some reasons why I chose this topic. In fact, trading is near and dear to me because it has allowed me to garner my curiosity and interest in the technology world, which is basically the reason I am majoring in Computer Science. Trading is the main reason that I have turned down many other life opportunities before attending BYUH. I struggled to find what I really wanted to do and what career I wanted to pursue after getting out of the military back in 2020. I stumbled across an invitation to trading online by one of the proprietary trading groups that would change my interests and goals towards success. Long story short, after 2 years of extensive learning, sleepless nights, and hands-on practices, I learned that Trading has become a part of my everyday life, it has become a passion. <br><br>
                I am currently attending school with the goal to take a break from trading, graduate and then have a decent source of income to fund my trading. I intend to make my contents based off of my own knowledge and less of what I was taught by the trading groups that I joined. The contents for each of the 5 pages are laid out below:
            </p>
        <h1>3. Contents</h1>
            <p>
                1st page <br>
                An Introduction Page that will consist of what FUTURES are, levels of trading, where you can find them and how you can trade them. This page will also have brief paragraphs at the end to transition to other pages. <br><br>

                2nd Page <br>
                I will discuss the adverse PATTERNS and HABITS that will develop throughout trading and the MINDSET to medicate them. <br><br>
                
                3rd Page <br>
                I will explain what TRADING INDICATORS are and why they’re used, adding how they’ll help make better decisions in trading. <br><br>
                
                4th Page <br>
                I will provide a list of the most trusted and reputable TRADING PLATFORMS that will help putting your first orders but I will not cover in full detail how you use the platforms. I will have a TABLE of products to choose from and to trade. <br><br>
                
                5th Page <br>
                Finally I will have content here to warn the readers that it is not my responsibility if they decide to look into trading after reading and also I will have a FORM placed here as well.
