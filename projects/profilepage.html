    <h1>Bonjour, Hallo, &amp; Ciao, my name is Betero</h1>
    <p>Wonder why <strong>Bonjour</strong>, <strong>Hallo</strong> and <strong>Ciao</strong>? History has always been interesting to me. While growing up, I would read a lot about the wars and the impact it had caused to civilization and the industrialization throughout Europe. It's fascinating that after all the unfortunate experiences they faced, their culture, buildings, and languages are still the same. I have great respect for these people and my curiousity is immense to learn more on how they preserved their ways. In fact, Iâ€™m most intrigued that they keep making and preserving these beautiful medieval looking buildings in <em>Germany</em>, skillfully carved-out cathedrals in <em>Italy</em>, and the historical <em>Arc De Triumph</em> that can still be seen in <em>France</em>.</p>
    <p>Life is short and there is so much to learn and explore. It's amazing to learn that there is a whole different world with different stories outside of that of your own. Although my interests have made known, I will remain unsatisfied in my adventures until I have visited these three amazing countries: </p>
