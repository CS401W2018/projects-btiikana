    <h2 class="emphasize3">Germany Adventure Awaits</h2>
<p>I had a German friend back in high school that was very smart and funny. He was the only German guy in class and he was different but everyday he would always bring <span class="emphasize3">Pretzel</span> snacks to school and would always tell everyone that it's a common snack in Germany. He would write the longest German words on the whiteboard such as "<span class="emphasize3">Rinderkennzeichnungsfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz</span>" just to be funny and I doubted the word was even a word but he wasn't lying. I later found out that <span class="emphasize3">Pretzels</span> were originated from the part of Europe that is now Germany and they were also enjoyed back in the middle ages around the 610 A.D. Additionally, the word "<span class="emphasize3">Rinderkennzeichnungsfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz</span>" was in fact a German word that has something to do with managing and labeling the cow meats or beef which is super funny and interesting.</p>
<p>It's interesting to me how they could just come up with the word <span class="emphasize3">"Rinderkennzeichnungsfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz"</span> and why, if you ever wonder! I mean we are unaware of the purpose, reasons, and history of most of the things that we see everyday, and the things that exist around us. For instance, "<span class="emphasize3">Pretzels</span>", I buy and enjoy <span class="emphasize3">Pretzels</span> every once in a while but I never knew that it's originated from Germany. I really like that fact that Germany has more for the eyes to see and for the mind to learn pertaining to culture, other than what's mentioned. I would love to know more about the other things that make Germany super unique and interesting, perhaps not now but soon.</p>
